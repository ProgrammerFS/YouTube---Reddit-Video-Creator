# YouTube---Reddit-Video-Creator
Through this project you can automate making videos from reddit and uploading them on YouTube. Currently, it only supports images but we hope to bring the ability to combine videos as well in the future.

You will need to create a YouTube Channel and also enable the Youtube Data api, which you can create by following this documentation : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

To run this module you will need two things : 
1) The client id, client secret and user agent of yourreddit app which can be created here : 
2) The client_secret.json from the youtube api. 

To run the module Simple paste your credentials in the combining.py and run the main.py file.

#Note : You will need to verify this app once but after that you don't need to do anything just run the combinig.py file and watch the magic unfold!
