# YouTube---Reddit-Video-Creator
Through this project you can automate making videos from reddit and uploading them on YouTube. Currently, it only supports images but we hope to bring the ability to combine videos as well in the future.

You will need to create a YouTube Channel and also enable the Youtube Data api, which you can create by following this documentation : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

To run this module you will need two things : 
1) The client id, client secret and user agent of yourreddit app which can be created here : 
2) The client_secret.json from the youtube api. 

To run the module simply paste your reddit credentials(client-id, client-secret, user-agent) in the combining.py and run the main.py file.

#Note : The channel has to be created before running this file. You will need to verify this app once (Please sign-in with the account on which you want to upload your videos on) but after that you don't need to do anything just run the main.py file and watch the magic unfold!
